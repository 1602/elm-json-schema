# JSON-Schema for elm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/1602/elm-json-schema.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/1602/elm-json-schema)

This code is experimental, it doesn't cover json schema spec (yet), just allows to parse minimal subset of it in order to implement very basic proof of concept of "type as value" in elm.

The end goal of this project is to cover json schema spec in full, if you're interested - feel free to pick up some of the open issues and submit PR. But do not expect this project to be ready this (or next) year, this is a development purely for fun, not for production use, unless you only need current functionality and don't plan to upgrade.

## Current functionality

TODO: describe what this library does at the moment.
